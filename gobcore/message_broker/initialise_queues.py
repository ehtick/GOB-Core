"""Message broker initialisation

The message broker serves a number of persistent queues holding persistent messages.

Creating persistent queues is an independent task.

The queues are required by the import and upload modules.
These modules are responsable for importing and uploading and not for creating the queues.

The initialisation of the queues is an integral part of the initialisation and startup of the message broker.

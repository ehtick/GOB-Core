"""Workflow configuration

Definition of the message broker queues, exchanges and routing keys.

Two main queues are defined:
    WORKFLOW - the normal import-upload traffic.
               Proposals (units of work) are received and routed by the workflow manager.
    LOG - the logging output of each GOB process is routed over this queue
